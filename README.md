# Paint-Draw Game with AI Image Comparison

## Use Case:
Two players go head to head and are given categories by the cnn to draw, once the cnn is satisfied the player moves on to the next category, first to finish wins.

## Technologies (subject to change):
- **CPP front end / Python server**
- **Python socket.io** (networking in Python)
- **RayLib** (graphics library for the painting app)
- **SKLEARN/KERAS** to train the CNN
- **PILLOW** for image processing

## TODO:
- **fix that one janky loop on the server side and test everything thoroughly**
- **add less static networking on server, for now it assumes both clients have steady connections**
